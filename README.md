A website designed to simulate the experience of writing or drawing in an invisible ink journal.

made at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in collaboration with [Isaac Chabon](https://ichabon.com/).

A looooong talk with an ooooold friend, knowledge hidden behind a bluelight. 
To toggle between drawing and reading in the journal, hitting the spacebar will turn the pen to a blue light flashlight, or the flashlight to a pen. When the pen is visible, press down with your mouse to write. Leave a secret or just read some [here](https://invisible-ink.onrender.com/).
